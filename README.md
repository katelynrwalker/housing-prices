# Predicting housing prices

Can we predict future house sale prices based on a dataset of past sales prices? 

The traditional method real estate agents use is to look at "comps" - other houses in the neighborhood with similar characteristics. Sounds a lot like k-nearest neighbors. We'll try that, and then also look at some decision tree models to see how those compare.

See the Jupyter notebook for a full walkthrough!
